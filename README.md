This project aims to perform a full “pre-mortem” use case analysis. This includes:
* Selecting one practically relevant data science question having a business or public policy connection.
* Developing a context in which this analytics problem can occur.
* Using the data science canvas as an orienting framework to make sure that the analysis is comprehensive and addresses all important issues.
* The project is executed in 3 phases
  * Conception phase - involves finding a use case and embedding it in a background story to turn it into a case study. The output is a written outline that describes the use case as well as the motivation for choosing it.
  * Development phase/reflection phase - the creation of a use-case analysis document by first excerpting the different subject areas of the Machine Learning Canvas as headers then summarizing thoughts on the subject matter in accordance with the use-case.
  * Finalization phase -the creation of an improved analysis document, including a short presentation that could be used to pitch the use case  to get managerial support and an abstract that describes the solution  in terms of content and concept, presenting a short break-down of  the technical approach in a clear and informative way.
